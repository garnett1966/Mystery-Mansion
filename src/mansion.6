MANSION(6)                                                      MANSION(6)

NAME
     mansion - a murder mystery text adventure

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/games/mansion

DESCRIPTION
     Discover who committed the murder, get the police to arrest them, and
     escape alive before the end of the day, when the world of mansion comes
     to an end.  Like adventure(6), mansion is more or less self-descriptive,
     and a large part of the game is simply to find out what you can and
     cannot do.  As far as can be ascertained, nobody has ever managed to
     get all 999 points, although it is entirely possible.

     To terminate a game, enter ``quit''; to save a game for later resumption,
     enter ``suspend'' and then ``restore'' in the first move of a new game
     to resume it.  If you want to play a specific mystery again, then
     enter ``mystery'' as the first command of a new game.  For hints, you
     can always enter ``help''.

HISTORY
     mansion appears to have been written originally around 1980 (or even
     earlier) for the HP1000 running RTE (Real Time Executive) and later
     ported to the HP3000 and MPE (Multi-Processing Executive).  It existed
     mainly under MPE until 1999, when it was ported to C and released to the
     Unix world for the sake of interactive-fiction lovers everywhere.


AUTHORS
     The game of mansion was written originally in Fortran IV by John Rasins.
     The C port was done by James Garnett (garnett@acm.org) in an effort
     to avoid finishing a dissertation.
