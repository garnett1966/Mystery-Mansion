Mystery Mansion was originally conceived of, designed, and written by 
Bill Wolpert while at the Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station
in Keyport, Washington.  Revision 16 of that game was the HP1000 version,
finalized in 1981.  Revision 17 was a nearly direct translation of that
to the HP3000.  This port is based upon the Revision 17 source code, with
modifications from the Revision 16 source for clarity.

Changes since version 19.4
---------------------------

   - Code repository moved to Github
   - Fixes per Alessandro Giassi

Changes since version 19.3
---------------------------

   - Other players can now be shot if you have the gun

Changes since version 19.2
---------------------------

   - Modified intro acknowledgement code to clearly identify Bill Wolpert
     as the author (based upon email from various persons).

   - Fixed curtain-closing code.  It had previously been possible to
     open curtains, but not to close them again.

   - Added swear words from version 16 back in, plus one question word
     which had been lost

   - Fixed two more logical and/or mistakes.  These made it impossible to
     look at certain items.  Yet another ZaneBug (YAZB)!


Changes since version 19.1
---------------------------
   
   - A paren problem made it impossible to actually solve the murder in
     previous versions.  Now fixed and verified.  This was another ZaneBug.

   - The heavy use of "goto"s (a result of the directness of the port
     from the original fortran) broke the way output buffers were 
     flushed, apparently, which led to weird output behavior after
     a scanf().  Replaced all scanf()'s with fgets(), and things are
     now happy again.

   - Verified correctness of the timing.  This had been in question
     wrt the cold corridor and how to get down it; I have now made
     a walkthrough that proves it works.  This isn't really a change,
     but it's still important.

   - Determined that "John Rasins," previously thought to be an author,
     was really just an Interex CSL archive contributor for one of
     the early revisions of the fortran source.  The real author has
     been tentatively identified as a "Bill Wolpert," which sounds familiar
     from my early days of playing this.  Changed this in the intro 
     acknowledgements.

Changes since version 19.00
---------------------------

   - Rebecca Zane found three fairly insidious bugs having to do with
     the way the globe dropped and how characters answered questions.
     All of these are now fixed in v19.1 and the responses appear to
     be the way we expected them to be.

   - Some of the formatting having to do with long responses to questions
     has been changed so that it doesn't linewrap past 80 columns.


Platform Support
----------------

Mystery Mansion is known to compile and run on the following platforms:

        OpenBSD 2.5, 2.6 (x86)
        OpenBSD 2.6 (sparc)
        Solaris 2.7 (x86 & sparc)
        SunOS 4.1.3_U1 
        DUNIX-4.0D 
        HP-UX 10.10, 10.20

It also compiles and runs in win32 (Windows 95/98/NT) environments, 
depending on the compiler you use.  I used Visual C++, and it compiled
with no real problems.
